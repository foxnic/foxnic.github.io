  My favourite part of the roles I've done over the years is helping businesses and software development teams to get valuable insights from data, and I'm now changing the course of my career to focus on Data Science. 
  <br>
  <br>
  I'm currently completing a Data Science MSc at Manchester Metropolitan University.
