<h1>Hi! I'm Nic Fox</h1>

  <div class="topimg"><img src="HeadShotCircle.png" style="width:33%;" alt="Nicola Fox" class="responsive"></div>
  <br>
  
  I'm an <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicola-fox-b52a6281/">experienced IT professional</a> with a Data Science MSc, Computing BSc and 20 years experience working in the IT industry, in the UK and abroad.

  I'm currently in my first year of a Criminology PhD at the University of Manchester, researching the identification of vulnerability and harm in return interviews with children who have been missing.
  
  <h2>Outside of Work</h2>
  
  When I'm not working or volunteering, I enjoy analysing open data for fun, running, cycling, swimming and sewing. I love learning new things and challenging myself.
