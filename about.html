<h1>About</h1>
  
  I'm an <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicola-fox-b52a6281/">experienced IT professional</a> with a Computing BSc and 18 years experience working in the IT industry, in the UK and abroad. Most of my time has been spent performing Business Analysis but I've also stepped into associated roles including Development Manager, Programme Manager and Architect. 
  
  My favourite part of the roles I've done over the years is helping businesses and software development teams to get valuable insights from data. I'm now changing the course of my career to focus on Data Science and I'm currently completing a Data Science MSc.
