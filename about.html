<h1>About</h1>
  
  I'm an <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicola-fox-b52a6281/">experienced IT professional</a> with a Computing BSc and 18 years experience working in the IT industry, in the UK and abroad. Most of my time has been spent performing Business Analysis but I've also stepped into associated roles including Development Manager, Programme Manager and Architect. 
  
  My favourite part of the roles I've done over the years is helping businesses and software development teams to get valuable insights from data. I'm now changing the course of my career to focus on Data Science and I'm currently completing a Data Science MSc.

  <h2>Outside of Work</h2>
  
  When I'm not at work / studying for my Data Science MSc / analysing data for fun, I enjoy running, cycling, swimming and sewing. 
  
  I enjoy learning new things and challenging myself. In the past I've done triathlons (including Ironman), bike races (track, time trial, road races and MTB), been the Membership Secretary for Manchester Wheelers cycling club, and set up and run a small online store to raise money for charity.
