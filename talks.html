    <h3>R Ladies Manchester</h3>
    
    On Tuesday 6th August 2019 I gave a talk at the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/rladies-manchester/events/262319624/">R Ladies Manchester meetup</a>.
    <br>
    <br>
    Talk synopsis:
    <br>
    Just Do It - How learning R by analysing a real data set that interested me taught me more than I intended to learn. Iâ€™ll talk about how I used R, R Markdown, HTML, CSS and GitHub together to analyse the data and share the insights I found.
