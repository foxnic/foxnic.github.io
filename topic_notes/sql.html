    <h1>SQL</h1>
    <center>Some notes and useful resources on Structured Query Language (SQL). </center>

    <br><br>
    
    SQL is a language for interacting with data in a relational database.
    <br><br>
    
    It's common practice to make SQL keywords uppercase but the query will also run successfully if keywords are in lower case. It's not case sensitive.
    <br><br>
    
    It's also common practice (but not essential) to include a semicolon at the end of a query to tell SQL where the end of the query is.
    <br><br>

    in <b>PostgreSQL, single quotes</b> must be used with the WHERE clause.
    <br><br>
    
    /* To print 'I love SQL!': */
    <br>
    SELECT 'I love SQL' <br>
    AS result; 
    <br><br>

    /* view the 'title' column in the 'movies' table */ <br>
    SELECT title <br>
    FROM movies;
    <br><br>

    /* show the number of rows in the countries table */
    SELECT COUNT(*) <br>
    FROM countries;
    <br><br>

    /* show the number of unique values of country in the countries table */
    SELECT DISTINCT country_name <br>
    FROM countries;
    <br><br>

    SELECT COUNT(surname) <br>
    FROM employees;
    <br><br>

    SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT surname) <br>
    FROM employees;
    <br><br>

    SELECT title <br>

    (Note: 'AND' must be on a new line, otherwise the code is not valid.)

    <br><br>

    SELECT (10 / 3);
    <br><br>

    SELECT AVG(duration)/60.0 AS avg_duration_hours <br>
    FROM movies;
    <br><br>

    Note: SQL assumes that if you divide an integer by an integer, you want to get an integer back. This means that the following will erroneously result in 400.0: <br><br>

    SELECT 45 / 10 * 100.0;<br><br>

    This is because 45 / 10 evaluates to an integer (4), and not a decimal number like we would expect. So when you're dividing make sure at least one of your numbers has a decimal place: <br><br>

    SELECT 45 * 100.0 / 10; <br><br>

    The above now gives the correct answer of 450.0 since the numerator (45 * 100.0) of the division is now a decimal <br><br>

    If the attribute to join on is the same in both tables, then USING can be used instead: <br><br>

    <h2>Set Theory Clauses</h2>

    <br>
    "Union All" double counts the items that overlap (hence the shading in black).
    <br><br>

    <h3>Union</h3>

    <img src="set_union.png" width=200 height=350>
    <br><br>

      UNION ALL <br>
    SELECT country_code, year <br>

    <h3>Intersect</h3>

      FROM countries <br>
      INTERSECT <br>
    SELECT name <br>

    A more complicated example, also using set tbeory clauses: <br><br>
